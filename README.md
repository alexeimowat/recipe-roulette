## Background
Welcome! Recipe Roulette is my personal project that I decided to create for me and my girlfriend to use at home. We love cooking and trying out 
new things, but sometimes it's hard to find new foods without having a starting point already. This app allows us to search for a random recipe 
through an API called [Spoonacular](https://spoonacular.com/food-api) and save it for future use. Of course there are other services that already 
exist online (have you heard of this new thing called Google?), but why use those when I could try and learn something new by building my own app?
Recipe Roulette is a great way for me combine my love for programming, food, and trying new things and I hope to one day deploy this for others to enjoy 
as well! 

## Features
Even though the app is run locally, I'd still love to showcase the features that I've developed! Click [here](https://youtube.com) for a demo video, or 
scroll down for screenshots. 

If you'd like to skip this section, you can go to the [Next Section](#Tech-Stack) or back to the [Contents](#Contents)

The app offers 2 main modes: 
- Get a new random recipe
- View my saved recipes

### Generating Random Recipes
The main screen of the app presents you with a random recipe (rendered immediately) and a button to generate a new random recipe.
You can save this recipe to a specific category by selecting the dropdown of the save button or generate a new random recipe.

Clicking 'Saved Recipes' in the header will take you to your saved recipes where you can view the recipes that you have saved based on the 
category you have saved them in.

Below we see the same recipe we saw after we saved it under the "Supper" category.

You can also press the 'Delete' button which will remove the given recipe from your saved list


## Tech Stack
I used a variety of technologies when building this app, some that I have previous experience with and some that were completely new to me. 

Below is a breakdown of the tech and languages used:
### Front-end
- Reactjs (JavaScript, JSX, HTML, CSS/SCSS)
- Node.js
- Axios
- Bootstrap/React-Bootstrap

### Back-end
- Node.js (express.js)
- CRUD API
- PostgreSQL (SQL)

## Moving Forward
Currently the app is run locally as I only intended to develop it for us and to use casually. However, after having a lot of fun with it I found myself 
coming up with many feature ideas for the app and think it would be awesome to deploy it one day to friends and family! 

If you're curious about my ideas head over to the issues tab of this repo to see my plans. 


Thanks for taking the time to read this and look at my project! If you have any questions (or suggestions) feel free to start a discussion with me!

Have a great day! :smile:
